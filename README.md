# minipylib

Current version: 0.2.9

Note: This package is still under alpha development so any code inside
is in transition and is not guaranteed to persist in future versions.

Minipylib is a small library of utility functions for developing
Python web applications. These functions do not require specific
frameworks so they should work with all Python code.
